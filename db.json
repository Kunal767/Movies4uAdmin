distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei, Andrew Garfield, and Tobey Maguire. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) to make his identity as Spider-Man a secret again with magic after its public revelation in Far From Home, but this breaks open the multiverse and allows supervillains from alternate realities to enter Parkers universe.\r\n\r\nA third MCU Spider-Man film was planned during the production of Homecoming in 2017. By August 2019, negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal\u2014in which they produce the Spider-Man films together\u2014ended with Marvel Studios leaving the project; however, a negative fan reaction led to a new deal between the companies a month later. Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return at that time. Filming began in October 2020 in New York City before moving to Atlanta that month and wrapping in March 2021. No Way Home explores the concept of the multiverse and ties the MCU to past Spider-Man film series, with numerous actors reprising their roles from the Spider-Man films directed by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb. The return of previous Spider-Man actors Maguire and Garfield was the subject of speculation, and Sony, Marvel, and the cast attempted to conceal their involvement despite numerous leaks."}, "2": {"movieInfo": {"Duration": "1 Hour 56 Minutes", "Language": "Hindi-English Dual Audio", "Category": "Movie", "Release Year": "2021", "Subtitles": "English", "Format": "Mkv"}, "fileUrl": {"1": {"linkSpec": "Download Red Notice 480p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Now 480p", "downloadLink": "https://slayycrypto.com/mov4ft34i4tf5/?token=WE1QYXVhRG9ZdHYyNjljaER2WHA1WjJTUUhBdWxlREpBdjdLaFFiK0tOTS9xVUZHSFYxQmlKMWtTbjZmbjgyaA"}, "2": {"linkSpec": "Download Red Notice 720p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Now 720p", "downloadLink": "https://slayycrypto.com/movy45y463/?token=WE1QYXVhRG9ZdHYyNjljaER2WHA1VlMzTTNjMENjZ3hoNlBuYlZ5aGpBRT0"}, "3": {"linkSpec": "Download Red Notice 1080p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Now 1080p", "downloadLink": "https://slayycrypto.com/moeed4r34t34viede3/?token=WE1QYXVhRG9ZdHYyNjljaER2WHA1WUpicUJOLytZaW5uZ2tUV3BjejFJUUlybGZTcHRaMTRQdDVjcDFlVjJkVA"}}, "imgUrl": "https://www.koimoi.com/wp-content/new-galleries/2021/10/red-notice-actors-dwayne-johnson-gal-gadot-ryan-reynolds-expected-salary-for-their-work-will-blow-your-mind-001.jpg", "movieName": "Red Notice", "description": "Red Notice is a 2021 American action comedy film written, directed, and produced by Rawson Marshall Thurber.

The brothers serve as showrunners and are executive producers along with Shawn Levy and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy (Will Byers) amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with psychokinetic abilities (Eleven). The second season focuses on Will's side effects from being in the Upside Down with its entities crawling into the real world. The third season focuses Eleven and Mike's relationship as the kids continue their battle against the Upside Down entities. The series stars an ensemble cast including Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Cara Buono and Dacre Montgomery.\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside supernatural elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the pop culture of that decade while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, and Stephen King, as well as anime and video games. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the Cold War and real world conspiracy theories involving secret government experiments."}, "9": {"movieInfo": {"Duration": "50 Minutes Each Episode", "Language": "Hindi-English Dual Audio", "Category": "Web Series", "Release Year": "2017-2021", "Subtitles": "English", "Format": "Mkv"}, "fileUrl": {"1": {"linkSpec": "Download Money Heist Season 1 480p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Season 1 Now 480p", "downloadLink": "https://econation.xyz/skfneodnmoneyekfnekseason1fjowdneo480pmelfnwkfnwkemwlwmdm/?token=VjRxbEtZQURKS0dKc2hHcUl3VGxubEF0Q1VpdEFCWUN4ZkFwdG5OZldFN1FIZldiYTM4enFPbmNpSG96ZW1JL2ZqVFFSNTNLYUpLZThRWWxjLzFoZGtUeVNjYXp4a3JnV0FmdDhyMjRCbDA9"}, "2": {"linkSpec": "Download Money Heist Season 2 480p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Season 2 Now 480p", "downloadLink": "https://econation.xyz/mrlrngosbforheistnsofmoneyaofneoenseason2fjekekdlsmksdn/?token=VjRxbEtZQURKS0dKc2hHcUl3VGxuamh3aEJ5ajV5WnRiQ0g5T21qa0FZL0tqZTZCbmZtbTFoeXYxTmplR3VybUlzeXR3M0R4NzR4RmErNGFGMFdOK3hYUDgyZkV6RXFjMGU4STA0ZjVJRVE9"}, "3": {"linkSpec": "Download Money Heist Season 3 480p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Season 3 Now 480p", "downloadLink": "https://econation.xyz/kdrjtoneogdnhetisigkefmoneywofneofbejh3djeotjeonfk964wkelekekekn/?token=VjRxbEtZQURKS0dKc2hHcUl3VGxucE14azFWTDlWS0c1bVFwZXdiVlNPTEY4Vy83bHpTdmtVYU9NYWpRNjcrVmpkU0pNQmJ1S3FFOUZyUVF5YmRPNlA5TFhtbU9qblZ1VlFSRDV4Q0dOTHdXNFpLN3Q2bldWWk16N0Qvdk1EUlQ"}, "4": {"linkSpec": "Download Money Heist Season 4 480p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Season 4 Now 480p", "downloadLink": "https://econation.xyz/kelrnriddb8djeorbiend865hiiskrnwlwkenskmoneywornwlwmdnsl/?token=VjRxbEtZQURKS0dKc2hHcUl3VGxudjVacDd3bUNBeW9ESzVKenlrYUxzS0x3VDBCMnMrNFAyQVU3ZnNHeFNTSWQwT2VIVllLSGE1c08rT1JPQ29wNlZiRHhsb0RmdHZqbTdOR3AxVUpyNWM9"}, "5": {"linkSpec": "Download Money Heist Season 5 Part 1 480p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Season 5 Part 1 Now 480p", "downloadLink": "https://slayygames.com/2440uh7j8hkj"}, "6": {"linkSpec": "Download Money Heist Season 5 Part 2 480p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Season 5 Part 2 Now 480p", "downloadLink": "https://slayycrypto.com/2684536sq3g7ht6rn2171/?token=WE1QYXVhRG9ZdHYyNjljaER2WHA1UUF0eVRmc1VrTjVJS1lMcTNObUlCYWpPYXFwMjJzSVNPTzNrV24yTkk5YQ"}, "7": {"linkSpec": "Download Money Heist Season 1 720p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Season 1 Now 720p", "downloadLink": "https://econation.xyz/moneyheisthindidubbedktnakdbwkkdfnladndkseasonekdn1fwkendl/?token=VjRxbEtZQURKS0dKc2hHcUl3VGxuc0pPcGtoSmVveklyZHg1UEVKSXF5bnlRelQ2bmhHSnZxQ1p5WXJpZ2dWRWZDN25ScWZRQzZXZDd0VzAxd0txc0dwZFFKMFN4SXN6a01KWVVtUTBuSFk9"}, "8": {"linkSpec": "Download Money Heist Season 2 720p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Season 2 Now 720p", "downloadLink": "https://econation.xyz/moneyheistkwnfoesmseason2nfelfjoedn86fnlasnskalsm/?token=VjRxbEtZQURKS0dKc2hHcUl3VGxuckRPUEpYTTRVbFhRY2VmUGt0dWY0UDhGS0IxempvZHdKVEVUTGtpRWVDVmFNb2w0UTFxQUx3U3Q0M3NKMHhWa2N5ZGNaV09zV3dYQmRSN1Y4azE0UGs9"}, "9": {"linkSpec": "Download Money Heist Season 3 720p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Season 3 Now 720p", "downloadLink": "https://econation.xyz/moneymsbfoefbheistnskfbdkeseason3dnsknfoenformslsdn86fnskdn/?token=VjRxbEtZQURKS0dKc2hHcUl3VGxubzNuSGRmOW9MUmxhdWhGOCs2cjlsNDR4YUhVb2k1WFJvU0ovSk04MVR0cXNGV2lEVXFBUVFkT1A4U1hjalhteVNKR2U2Qm1lKzRkbm1mdk5acU9jTzg9"}, "10": {"linkSpec": "Download Money Heist Season 4 720p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Season 4 Now 720p", "downloadLink": "https://econation.xyz/mdkrnwofnmoneyheisstkwkekefnskseason4dnkwfnossn720pjedkowndlssmn/?token=VjRxbEtZQURKS0dKc2hHcUl3VGxucmNnRjJKUFQrQSswSi9EcGJNMnhxMzVsRm52N3VsWEtHanN3YVgvMVQ1Vit6bFhBQmFLSU13cVpnQlhGOUhrWUc1V0F6eWVkc0hPd3dGc0s2WkFSb05XbGZzREs3VTZTeFVvblFlaUFOSFU"}, "11": {"linkSpec": "Download Money Heist Season 5 Part 1 720p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Season 5 Part 1 Now 720p", "downloadLink": "https://slayygames.com/2467tg6yttf4"}, "12": {"linkSpec": "Download Money Heist Season 5 Part 2 720p Hindi-English Dual Audio", "downloadText": "Download Season 5 Part 2 Now 720p", "downloadLink": "https://slayycrypto.com/22165e4tcexwfrw4c/?token=WE1QYXVhRG9ZdHYyNjljaER2WHA1ZkovVGp1Mk5ROHMzQ0thSitGUjFuVktYRWpYSDBWNkYzZjdIWUZPYUl4WA"}}, "imgUrl": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/styles/zm_700x400/public/2021/05/25/938590-money-heist.png", "movieName": "Money Heist", "description": "Money Heist (Spanish: La casa de papel, [la \u02c8kasa de pa\u02c8pel], 'The House of Paper') is a Spanish heist crime drama television series created by \u00c1lex Pina.

The series is produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios and Bohemian Risk Productions, with Lightfoot serving as showrunner.\r\n\r\nThe series revolves around Frank Castle, who uses lethal methods to fight crime as the vigilante 'The Punisher', with Jon Bernthal reprising the role from Daredevil.

The film is set sixty years after the events of Revolutions and follows Neo, who lives a seemingly ordinary life as a video game developer troubled with distinguishing dreams from reality. A group of rebels, with the help of a programmed version of Morpheus, free Neo from an altered Matrix and fight a new enemy that holds Trinity captive.\n\nFollowing the release of Revolutions, the Wachowskis denied the possibility of another Matrix film, though rumors emerged since then about a possible fourth Matrix film and the studio constantly expressed interest in reviving the franchise, hiring Zak Penn to write a new screenplay after the Wachowskis refused every offer to create more sequels. In late 2019, a fourth Matrix film was finally announced, with Lana Wachowski returning as director without her sister and Reeves and Moss reprising their roles. Filming started in February 2020 but was halted the next month by the COVID-19 pandemic. Wachowski toyed with the possibility of shelving the project and leaving the film unfinished, but the cast insisted that she finish it.
